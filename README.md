# Bank Loan Default Prediction

This project performs end-to-end analysis and machine learning on a bank loan dataset in order to:
- understand customer characteristics and trends,
- calculate key performance indicators (KPIs),
- visualize business insights, and
- predict whether a loan is likely to default.

The entire analysis is done using a Python Jupyter Notebook (`Bank_Loan.ipynb`) and includes both exploratory analysis and model building (Random Forest classifier).

## üìå Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the raw bank loan dataset  
- Perform descriptive analytics and derive KPIs  
- Visualize key metrics (loan purpose, home ownership, state distribution, etc.)
- Build a machine learning model to classify **Good** vs **Bad** loans
- Allow user to test the prediction with custom input values

## üîé  Workflow Summary

| Step | Description |
|------|------------|
| 1 | Load the CSV data and inspect the structure |
| 2 | Handle missing values and duplicates |
| 3 | Convert dates and numeric columns to correct datatype |
| 4 | Calculate basic KPIs (MTD Applications, Avg Interest Rate, Good vs Bad loan amount etc.) |
| 5 | Create visualizations (monthly trend, loan term distribution, home ownership treemap, etc.) |
| 6 | One-hot encode categorical variables |
| 7 | Train/Test split |
| 8 | Build and evaluate a **RandomForestClassifier** |
| 9 | Allow user to enter new applicant info for prediction |
